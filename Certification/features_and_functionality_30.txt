3.10 EXTENSIONS AND CUSTOMIZATIONS:

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Marketplace

• • Magento’s store to purchase modules.
• • Module developers upload modules and profit share with Magento.
• • Magento runs extensive QA on the modules to ensure they fit the requirements.
• • Merchants or developers purchase modules from this and install.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Installation

• • Installation is fairly straightforward.
• • If using composer, add the module into composer:
• • composer requires vendor/module
• • Then:
• • bin/magento module:enable vendor_module
• • bin/magento setup:upgrade
• • bin/magento setup:di:compile
• • QA the website to ensure that everything works as expected.
• • Deploy to product and retest to ensure that everything still works as expected.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Differences between Magento 1 Marketplace and Magento 2 Marketplace

• • Magento Connect had little in the way of QA for the modules uploaded.

• • Magento Connect did not share profits at all.

• • Magento Marketplace uses composer to enable access to modules.

• • Magento Marketplace filters modules to ensure that there is only one approved module per category.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

• • This question is misleading. It is not possible to disable an extension in Admin.

• • You can disable a module’s output: Stores > Configuration > Advanced > Disable Modules Output.

• • This just prevents a module from showing any HTML. The module still can run in the background.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

When is a customization required?

• • While this is technically possible in the database in CE, the admin interface makes it much easier.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Customer account features and functionality (wishlists, gift registry, returns)

• • Wishlists are a CE and EE feature of Magento. This allows the customer to create a selection of products that they wish to purchase (or others to purchase for them) in the future. The
wishlists are private but can be shared via email with other customers. Enterprise supports multiple wishlists per customer.

• • Gift Registry is an EE-only feature of Magento. The registry allows customers to create a public list of products that they wish to be purchased. Often this is used for weddings and baby showers and
similar events.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

• • CMS blocks are reusable pieces of content. Maybe you have an author’s bio to be used on the website. You could place that bio in a static block and insert that (using a widget) almost anywhere you
    want on the website.
