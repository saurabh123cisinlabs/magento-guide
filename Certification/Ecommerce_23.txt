1.1 ONLINE MERCHANDISING:

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Marketing strategies:

Omnichannel: available in literally every touchpoint that a customer wants to interact with the brand. This likely includes a brick-and- mortar presence, website, social, phone and more. This also includes the notion of a customer being able to easily switch channels through their buying process. 

mobile->website->store->shop->mobile


++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Multichannel: 
non-integrated touch points. A customer cannot switch channels through the buying process. This more has to do with silos of communication than anything else.


+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Affiliate marketing: 
using incentives such as cashback and other rewards to encourage people to recommend your brand. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Social marketing: 
the use of social media (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, LinkedIn, etc) to spread the word about your company and interact with customers.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Email marketing: 
the use of email to continue brand awareness. This remains as one of the most effective means of communication.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Word of mouth marketing: 
the most effective marketing strategy. A customer loves your brand so much that they tell others about it.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Basic steps of setting up a new online store:

Strategy (90%): who is your competition. and what will set you apart? What are you offering that your competitors will not offer? Why do you want to get into this business?


Technology (10%):

• • Determining the platform to start with. If this is a small company with limited funds, Magento is likely not the best option. A SaaS platform is likely to be the best option. It has a low cost of entry (monthly fees) and has many features.

• • Hosting: We like MageMojo, but there is a plethora of hosting options on the market. It is good to talk with the hosting company to determine the server specifications necessary to find the right balance between computing power and paying too much.

• • Deployment: getting the site going. Launching a new site is much easier than migrating existing websites. You just have to point the domain name at the store, remove any temporary protections (such as a password entry present during development), and you are good to go.

• • Maintenance: the basic level of maintenance (from a developer’s point of view) includes patching. From a store owner’s view, they need to keep the products up to date, fulfill orders, and follow their strategy for growing the company.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Search Strategies:

• • Proceeding under the basis of this being site search.

• • Keyword search:

• Customers need to find things on your website. Hopefully the search bar is very visible. They will type in a query. Removing the cruft (“and,” “the,” etc.), you are left with likely the keywords of their search. These are the important words used to find products on your website.

• • Auto-suggest:

• Based on the keywords and phrases used, smart search engines will be able to find other keywords and phrases that are similar to the one that the customer entered.

• This will help guide them to the answer that they are looking for.

• • Guided Navigation:

• This implies helping the customer reach the decision you want them to reach (likely resulting in a purchase).

• This technology is still up and coming and relatively expensive to do right.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Upsell:

• Visible on a product page.

• This tells customers of more expensive or (hopefully) alternative choices to what they are looking at. This provides awareness of other options on your website.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Cross-selling:

• After the customer has added the product to the cart, we do not want to show choices to what they have purchased. Doing so might lead them to reconsider their options.

• Cross-selling involves showing the customer complementary products: ones that will make using the original product easier or more satisfying.


+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


SEO in ecommerce:

• • Far beyond the scope of this work, but, here’s the summary.

• • Quality URL structure:

• Don’t use numbers or IDs in the structure. Instead, use words. Not too many, but 75 characters or so in the url.

• • Good information architecture:

• This describes how your website is constructed.
• What are the paths to the categories? How do they relate to the products? Is there any correlation? What about breadcrumbs? How do you expect people to flow through your website?
• Are there well-organized sections of content?

• • Duplicate content:

• Using rel=”canonical” to avoid duplicate content flags.
• The canonical tag tells search engines which single URL is the source for that product.
• Common within Magento will be a product in multiple categories, resulting in the same product page accessible via several URL paths (one for each category). If you don’t tell Google which URL is the “master” (vs. the duplicates), Google will pick one.
• Ensuring that those canonical links exist.

• • Sitemap

• Helps search engines find the pages on your website.

====================================================================================================================================================================================================================

1.2 SECURITY:

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

• • User data security standards in different markets:

• USA is one of the most lenient in the world.
• EU data privacy states that you cannot store most any customer data outside of the EU. Used to have safe harbor agreement in place, but that no longer exists.
• Canada just introduced very strict spam laws.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

• • PCI standards and processes: (payment card industry)

• PCI SAQ (self-assessment questionnaire): a detailed piece of information to assess whether you and your website are following best security practices.
• Cardholder data must not ever be stored or transmitted unencrypted.
• Unencrypted cardholder data must not be seen by unqualified individuals.
• Encrypted cardholder data is still subject to safety measures.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

• • PA-DSS / PCI-DSS rules and practices:

• Every organization that handles credit cards needs to comply with PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard).
• Build and maintain a secure network.
• Protect cardholder data.
• Implement strong access control measures.
• Ensure the maintenance of information security policies.
• Vendors that make and sell payment applications need to meet PA DSS (Payment Application Data Security Standard).

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

SSL Usage in ecommerce:

• SSL when transmitting cardholder data is a must.

• Preferably use TLS 1.2 but limited due to older browsers that no longer support that.

• Browser vendors are pretty much forcing all sites to switch to https.

• SSL: Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is a standard security technology for establishing an encrypted link between a server and a client—typically a web server (website) and a browser, or a mail server and a mail client.

=====================================================================================================================================================================================================================

1.3 USER EXPERIENCE:

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

• • Usability principles and issues in ecommerce

• Beyond the scope of this study guide. Excellent resources:

• Interface must be easy and quick to understand.

• Best is that it doesn’t deviate too much from other websites / industry leaders such as Amazon.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

• • Building a good user experience in ecommerce — best practices

• Maximum of 5 options
• Important to give the user context of their position on the website
• Clear header navigation (with possible drop-down menus)
• Breadcrumbs
• Good detail in footer

=====================================================================================================================================================================================================================

1.4 LAWS AND REGULATIONS:

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

• • Disability compliance issues

• • Privacy

=====================================================================================================================================================================================================================

1.5 SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT:

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

• • Agile, SCRUM, and Waterfall

• Waterfall: working toward a once-in-a-long time release schedule.
• Agile and Scrum are very similar.
• Agile is a complete software development cycle. Usually focuses on smaller increments.
• Scrum is based around a sprint (a set period of time for work to get done). Commitments are made to ensure that the work is completed.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

• • Basic terms and core constituents of system development life cycles:

• Identify Current Problems: understanding problems. Customers often do this on their own, although it is good to get a second opinion.
• Plan: developing a roadmap for getting the problem solved.
• Design: architecting the solution: what pieces need to be built.
• Build: writing the code to solve this problem.
• Test: assigning to QA to ensures that everything works as expected.
• Deploy: deploying the update.
• Maintain: starting the cycle over again.

====================================================================================================================================================================================================================

1.6 OMNICHANNEL:

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

• • Complex inventory management:

• Means maintaining inventory in multiple locations. This could take into account warehousing, retail locations and possibly drop-shipped inventory quantities.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

• •How to handle out-of-stock merchandise:

• Online: can drop-ship from suppliers or distributors.
• Retail / brick-and-mortar: endless aisle systems allow customers to order items that are out of stock. This will not eliminate the problem of someone seeing that a product is not available anymore and leaving, but it might help in some situations.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

• • Drop ship:

• When the manufacturer or another company ships the product. This can reduce warehousing needs but will significantly eat into profits.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

• •Buy online / ship to store:

• The latest trend. This can be an effective means of keeping customers in the store. While it might not save the company any money (as they still often have to ship it), they can expect more people to make purchases while in the store. Walmart has seen this enough that they have offered steep discounts on certain Site-To-Store purchases.

====================================================================================================================================================================================================================

1.7 DATA ANALYTICS AND TESTING:

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

• • Google Universal Analytics:

• Probably the most powerful web analytics platform on the internet (free). This platform helps track and correlate much information about visitors on the website and their purchases.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

• •A/B Testing:

• Shows customers the A (original) or B (updated) version. This is good to see what users prefer more: which performs better and achieves more goal completions.

• The next step is Multivariate testing. This can pit multiple versions against each other to find a winning combination.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

• • Optimization:

• The process of continually editing and working with the website to increase sales.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

• •Personalization:

• Ways to make the website be unique to a user. This could be things like using the customer’s name, showing them products that they are interested in (based on other purchases), or adjusting sales emails to how they have responded to previous emails.

=====================================================================================================================================================================================================================

1.8 TAXES:

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

• • VAT:

• Value Added Tax
• Assessed at different times in the production process.
• Sales tax is assessed on the final value of a sale.

• • Digital VAT:

• Tax assessed on software as a service sales.

• •In-state and out-of-state:

• In-state: selling from one state in the US (such as KS) to someone in the same state.
• Out-of-state: selling from one state in the US (such as KS) to someone outside of the state, such as MO.
• Cross-border: Selling from one country into another.


+==================================================================================================== Questions=====================================================================================================

=> What is the difference between omnichannel and multichannel retailing?

• • Multichannel means that each channel of interacting with a
company is siloed. There is little organization and universal
strategy. Seems to be mostly an anti-pattern.

• • Omnichannel is where all lines of access to the company are
coordinated. Similar teams. The goal is to reduce the friction across
the experiences and make it as seamless as possible.


+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

=> How can you set up a product catalog for best search results, taking into account issues of duplicate content, meta content, meta title, keyword search terms in product description, attribute weight, and so
on?	

• • Key is to think about what people are looking for and use those
words. It is far more involved than this, as talking to customers,
research in Google Analytics, and watching results over time will
make the difference.

• • Duplicate content is bad. Thus, the rel=”canonical” meta tag is very
important to tell Google what is the “master” page. Magento by
default brings in this issue with products: products are viewable
just under the root domain (https://example.com/product-name)
and also viewable under each category (https://example.com/
category-name/product-name). Ensuring that the rel=”canonical” is
on will make that tag point to the product under the root domain.

• • Meta content (meta description?): is a shortened description that is
often used by Google under the title of the page (the title tag). This
is very important that there aren’t duplicate descriptions as these
can be customized to increase a customer’s likelihood of clicking
your url.

• • In the baked-in catalog search, the attribute weight determines
how likely Magento will return a match from that attribute.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

=> What is a “canonical link element”?

• • <link rel=”canonical” href=”http://example.com/wordpress/seo-
plugin/”>

• • This link tag tells search engines what is the original page. This
is helpful to clean up duplicate content. Each of those duplicates
should then point back to one page, and the page authority will be
focused on that one spot.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

=> What “social merchandising” techniques and tools are used in ecommerce?

• • The features or tools that encourage people to interact with your
website.

• • Could be a wishlist or sharing buttons.

• • This also would include tailoring related products or suggestions to
that person.

• • Reviews are means of attracting social proof, which is very
effective in both generating more content for a website as well as
encouraging other customers to purchase.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

=> When is SSL required when transacting data online?

• • SSL is required for any time credit card information is transferred
from a customer’s computer.

• • However, browsers are making SSL required. For example, a
message now appears when you log into a website (entering in
your password), and you are not on an SSL connection.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++=

=> What is PA-DSS? When should PA-DSS be applied?

• • It helps achieve PCI-DSS compliance. A good overview for this is
the PCI Awareness Training.

• • All organizations that handle cardholder data must be PCI-DSS
compliant.

• • PA-DSS is validating compliance of a system or a program. PCI-DSS
is the validation of an organization (meaning the people, systems
and hardware).

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

=> What are typical omnichannel challenges?

• • How to allow a customer to switch channels seamlessly?

• • Personalization of the experience to the customer depending on
what channel they are a part of.

• • Real-time inventory tracking.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

=> What is the process for getting a site certified as PCI compliant?

• • Determine merchant level.

• • Visa

• • MasterCard

• • This determines whether a SAQ will work or if you have to
have an on-site assessor.

• • Determine the SAQ.

• • Complete the SAQ.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

=> What are best practices for protecting ecommerce user data?

• • Don’t store cardholder or other sensitive data. It is good to see the
“saved credit card” option gone with Magento 2.

• • Be careful with who handles cardholder data.

• • Use strong hashing for passwords. This is another benefit of
Magento 2.

• • Use https on the website to protect cardholder and other data.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

=> What are the best usability practices when building an online catalog and checkout system?

• • As alluded to above:

• Don’t stray too much from what the user considers the norm.
This can vary per demographic or age group.

• • Keep things simple:

• < 5 choices
• Clear calls to action (such as Add to Cart or Checkout)
• Enough whitespace to set apart important elements.
• Keep the cart link obvious, don’t assume that the customer will
always go straight to checkout.
• Ensure the user has context for where they are on the website.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++=

=> What are the main characteristics of Agile and Waterfall development methodologies?

• • Agile is iterative; Waterfall is a longer period of work with less
opportunities for feedback.


• • Waterfall was more beneficial in the days of software distribution
on CD-ROM. You needed to completely finalize the software before
shipping it as delivering bugs to customers was a very bad thing.
Also, it needed to have plenty of upgrades for the user to feel it
was worthwhile to purchase and upgrade.

• • Agile fits better with other delivery means (automatic).

• • Because one can deploy often, it gives much faster feedback, and
the product doesn’t have to be polished. Instead of one release a
year, you can release weekly or even daily.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

=> What are SMART requirements?

• • Specific: the task must be defined.

• • Manageable: the task must not be of gargantuan proportions.

• • Assignable: the task must be able to be given to someone(s).

• • Relevant: the task must be able to be completed given current
bandwidth.

• • Time-related: the task must be able to be completed within a
certain time.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

=> What are the requirements of the EU “cookie law”?

• • Required after May 2011 (though, to my understanding, it is very
poorly enforced).

• • It requires that a website give customers the option to opt out of
cookies being set on their computer.


• • Requires that a website:

• tells visitors that the website uses cookies.

• explains what the cookies do

• gets their approval for storing cookies on their computer.


• •
The Cookie Law is a piece of privacy legislation that requires websites to get consent from visitors to store or retrieve any information on a computer, smartphone or tablet.

It was designed to protect online privacy, by making consumers aware of how information about them is collected and used online, and give them a choice to allow it or not. 

It started as an EU Directive that was adopted by all EU countries in May 2011. The Directive gave individuals rights to refuse the use of cookies that reduce their online privacy. Each country then updated its own laws to comply. In the UK this meant an update to the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations.
